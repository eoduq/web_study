    <p>We were good, we were gold
    Kinda dream that can't be sold
    We were right 'til we weren't
      Built a home and watched it burn</p>
    <p>Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
    I didn't wanna lie
      Started to cry but then remembered I</p>
    <p>I can buy myself flowers
    Write my name in the sand
    Talk to myself for hours
    Say things you don't understand
    I can take myself dancing
    And I can hold my own hand
      Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p> 
    <p>Can love me better
    I can love me better, baby
    Can love me better
    I can love me better, baby
    </p><p>Paint my nails, cherry red
    Match the roses that you left
    No remorse, no regret
      I forgive every word you said</p>
    <p>Ooh, I did not wanna leave you, baby
    I didn't wanna fight
      Started to cry but then remembered I</p>
